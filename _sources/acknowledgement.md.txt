# Acknowledgement

I would like to thank Jakub Jirsa for helping me to start building this
project and for coming up with ways to fasten the data unpacking. Also, thanks
to Lada Radmacherova for helping me with preparing the different examples of
how the main functions in the package can be used. And a thank you goes to
Dmitrii Sevaev for his work on multiprocessing codes and general
improvement of the package.
